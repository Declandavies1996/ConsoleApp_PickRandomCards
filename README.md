# Pick Random Cards - Readme

## Overview
This console application, "PickRandomCards," is an exercise from Chapter 3 of the Head First C# book. The program enables users to specify the number of cards they want to pick, and the `CardPicker` class generates and displays random cards.

## Learning Objectives
This exercise focuses on reinforcing key concepts introduced in Chapter 3:

1. **Static Methods:** The `CardPicker` class employs static methods (`PickSomeCards`, `RandomSuit`, `RandomValue`) to encapsulate functionalities related to card picking without the need for an instance of the class.

2. **Randomization:** The application utilizes the `Random` class to introduce randomness when picking both suits and card values, demonstrating the practical application of randomization techniques in C#.

3. **User Input Handling:** The `PickRandomCards` program engages the user by prompting them to input the number of cards they want to pick. The application validates user input to ensure it is a valid number, emphasizing proper user interaction.

## Getting Started
To run the application:

1. Copy and paste the provided code into your preferred C# development environment.
2. Run the `PickRandomCards` program.
3. Enter the desired number of cards when prompted.

## Key Components
- **CardPicker Class:** This class comprises static methods (`PickSomeCards`, `RandomSuit`, `RandomValue`) for picking random cards, demonstrating the use of static members in a practical context.

- **PickRandomCards Program:** The main program engages the user, prompting them to input the number of cards they want to pick and displaying the randomly generated cards.

## Card Generation
The `CardPicker` class generates a specified number of random cards, each comprising a random value and suit. The values include numbered cards (2 to 10), face cards (Jack, Queen, King), and the Ace.

## Reflection
As you interact with this exercise:

- **Static Methods:** Consider how static methods are used in the `CardPicker` class. Reflect on the appropriateness of using static methods for the card-picking functionality.

- **Randomization:** Explore how randomness is introduced into the application. Consider how the combination of random suits and values contributes to the variety of generated cards.

- **User Interaction:** Evaluate the user interaction in the `PickRandomCards` program. Consider whether the program effectively handles user input and provides meaningful output.

By reflecting on these aspects, you can reinforce your understanding of static methods, randomization, and user input handling in C# applications, aligning with the concepts introduced in Chapter 3 of the Head First C# book.
